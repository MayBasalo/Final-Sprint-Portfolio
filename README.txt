This is my submission for the personal component of the final sprint.

I experimented with a few designs on Figma, but at first, none of them seemed promising.

I really like this end result due to how easy it will be to expand upon once I have
more stuff to show off. I also like how clean and professional it ended up looking; I'm
probably actually going to use this page to show off my resume/cv.

As a side note, this was a great idea for a final project for the sprint, and I happy
that I got to make something that I'm going to use in the future!
